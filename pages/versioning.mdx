# Versioning

Third-party integrations can be updated at any time. For efficiency, the LLM-based platform may cache the `intents.json` file and only update it when necessary. This is where versioning comes into play.

## Relevant Fields

1. `schema`: The schema version of the `intents.json`. For version 1, it should be set to `v1`.
2. `version`: The version of the `intents.json`. This should be a string in semantic versioning format.

## Instructions for Intent Providers

1. Update the `version` field whenever you update the `intents.json`.
2. Update the `schema` field whenever you change the schema of the `intents.json`.
3. Deploy the `intents.json` as a static file, similar to how files are served on a CDN. This approach makes it easier to detect changes using response headers like `ETag` and `Last-Modified`, allowing LLM-based platforms to cache it using standard static file logic.

## Instructions for LLM-based Platforms

1. Check the `version` field and update the cache if the version has changed.
2. Check the `schema` field and validate the `intents.json` against the corresponding schema.
3. Cache the `intents.json` and follow standard caching logic as you would for a normal static file.
